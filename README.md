# Gradient-Origin-Networks-Julia
Reimplementation of Gradient Origin Networks in Julia with Knet Framework (Koç University Deep Learning Framework).

This repo will contain the Julia implementation of the paper Gradient Origin Networks [1] with the Koç University Deep Learning Framework (Knet).

# TODO
-> This readme file will contain more details about the implementation.

-> I will provide my LaTex report after I am done with the experimentations

# Implementation Environment Details

-> Julia Version Info: Version 1.6.3 (2021-09-23)

-> Platform Info :  "OS: Linux (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu) CPU: Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6248 CPU @ 2.50GHz, GPU : CuDevice(0): Tesla T4"

-> Required Julia Packages : Specified in requirements.txt file

-> Pytorch Debug Files : The codes in Pytorch_Debug_Files are based on the published GON implementation [2] which provides loggers for train and test set loss values for each epoch. I use them to compare my Julia implementation with Pytorch implementation.
